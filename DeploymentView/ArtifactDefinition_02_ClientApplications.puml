  **Artifact Definition - Client Applications**
  
  **Artifact Types:**
  • <<artifact, iOS>>: iOS application bundle (.ipa)
  • <<artifact, Android>>: Android application package (.apk)
  • <<artifact, web>>: Web application files (.html, .js, .css)
  • <<artifact, library>>: JavaScript/Native libraries
  
  **Mobile App Artifacts:**
  • customer-app.ipa/.apk (10,000+ installs)
  • helper-app.ipa/.apk (1,000+ installs)
  • manager-app.ipa/.apk (1,000+ installs)
  
  **Web App Artifacts:**
  • admin-dashboard.js (React SPA)
  • admin-dashboard.html
  • admin-dashboard.css
  
  **Common Libraries:**
  • React Native 0.72 (Cross-platform mobile framework)
  • Axios 1.5 (HTTP client)
  • FCM SDK 9.2 (Push notification)
  
  **Configuration Artifacts:**
  • app-config.json (API endpoints, feature flags)
  • tls-certificates.pem (Certificate pinning)
  • fcm-device-token.txt (Push notification token)
  
  **QA Considerations:**
  • Security: Certificate pinning, TLS 1.3
  • Usability: Cross-platform (iOS/Android), SPA (Web)
  • Availability: FCM Push (Manager App)
  • Modifiability: React Native (fast iteration)
